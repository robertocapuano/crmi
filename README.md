Cluster RMI

Our work has been aimed at making it easy and simple programming of cluster systems in Java. To do that, our efforts have been directed in two different directions. Reduce the life cycle of distributed applications, eliminating the use of post-compilers. And make efficient at run-time the computation time inter-node and intra-node. It is tried to reduce the time intra-node by a process of serialization lightweight, and at the same time reduce the time inter-node, through the use of a communication protocol efficient.
